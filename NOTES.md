# TODO

- [ ] Add geolocation based on IP address (need 3rd party service?)
- [ ] Test with multiple tabs, try to break the record script
- [ ] Add dashboard
- [ ] Test CORS headers / separate domains
- [ ] Figure out how to get Referer info for noscript.gif route
- [ ] Ensure IP address check works in Fly, do we need to read the Fly IP header instead?
- [ ] Are there cases where we need to listen for beforeunload or is visibilitychange enough?
